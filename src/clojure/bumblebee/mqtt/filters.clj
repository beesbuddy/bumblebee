;; Minimal, hot-reloadable filter chain for programmable broker behavior.
;; Public contract (stable):
;; - A filter is a pure-ish fn of 1 arg: (fn [event] result)
;; - `event` is a map: {:type :connect|:publish|:subscribe|:unsubscribe|:pingreq|:other
;;                      :ctx  io.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext
;;                      :msg  io.netty.handler.codec.mqtt.MqttMessage (or subtype)
;;                      ...extensible keys}
;; - `result` is a map with :action and optional payload:
;;   {:action :next    :event event'}   ; continue to next filter/handler (optionally mutated event)
;;   {:action :deny    :reply netty-msg?} ; optionally reply then close
;;   {:action :close}                    ; close connection, no reply
;;   {:action :handled}                  ; stop chain, do not forward
;;
;; Authors can either:
;; - Provide a bare fn matching the contract and call `add!`/`remove!`, or
;; - Use `deffilter` helper macro to attach name/priority metadata and register it.
;;
;; Optionally, you can validate filters during development by wrapping with `validate-filter`.

;; Specs to document and optionally validate the contract (lightweight; non-enforcing by default)
